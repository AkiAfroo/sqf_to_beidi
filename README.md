# SQF to Beidi Converter

This tool is no longer maintained by me, so I've put it here on github.  If you would like to contribute to this tool then by all means make a pull request, fork it or wtf ever you want to do.

You can request support for this tool from others on the [OpenDayZ forums](http://opendayz.net/threads/release-sqf-to-biedi-converter-importer.15424/) but I do not play dayz anymore, and really don't have time for it as much as I use to.  So don't expect a response from me.  

This tool took me awhile to figure out how to build and I think it's a great tool for it's purpose, so I really wanted to keep it on the web, but with me moving my server, it's just an extra file I can deal without.
